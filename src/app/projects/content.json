Two dedicated sound systems were professionally engineered—one optimized for background dining music, and the other for live band performances.

The client required even background music coverage across all common areas, with a sound profile that feels refined and balanced, and that aligns seamlessly with the modern interior design—without any space feeling disconnected.\n\nThrough precise speaker placement and a scalable, event-ready sound solution, the system transitions effortlessly from relaxed daytime ambience to social evenings, DJ sessions, and live singing. Audio remains comfortable and clear at lower levels, yet powerful and controlled when higher energy is required—delivering a confident, performance-ready experience without visual clutter. Integrated discreetly into the architecture, the solution enhances atmosphere while preserving the venue’s premium design intent.\n"

          "We delivered a fully integrated professional AV solution designed to support live performances, presentations, and multimedia events with clarity, flexibility, and reliability. The client required a system that could handle everything from spoken-word programs to high-energy performances, while remaining intuitive to operate and adaptable to different event formats.\n\nFor audio, we specified the K-array KR402 powered stereo system for its ultra-lightweight design and powerful, controlled sound, supported by a Behringer X32 digital console and S16 stagebox for flexible signal management. A range of Sennheiser wireless microphones—including handheld, bodypack, and headworn options—ensures clear vocal reproduction for presenters, performers, and panel discussions. Playback sources are handled seamlessly via the TACH MF4000 media player, supporting multiple formats for reliable daily operation.\n\nThe visual system was designed for impact and versatility, centred around a Panasonic PT-DW750BA 7,000-lumen projector paired with a custom motorised projector lift and a 16′ x 16′ motorised screen, allowing the technology to disappear when not in use. Gefen HDMI distribution and matrix switching enables smooth routing of multiple sources, including Blu-ray playback, across the system. Together, the solution delivers a polished, event-ready environment where sound and visuals work in harmony—supporting professional performance while maintaining a clean, considered design aesthetic."

One of KL’s most expensive bars being built to date, it’s a venue where the imagination can run wild as you take in the intricate detail of the hand-cast designs by Ashley Sutton himself. A cult brand, The Iron Fairies origins’ draw back to the story books written by Australian iron ore miner-turned-interior designer Ashley Sutton who escaped into a fantasy world of fairies which then inspired the tale that immortalised into what is The Iron Fairies bars today.The Butterfly Room is where 50, 000 handmade butterflies hang from the ceiling and a DJ on Friday & Saturday is setting the tone accordingly with music ranging from old-school house to techno from midnight till 5am. Think along the style of Joey Negro, Frankie Knuckles, Derrick Carter, and so on. The Fairy Garden encapsulates the life & soul of The Iron Fairies. With different areas for seating and dancing reinforced with a powerful sound system by K-array, this rooftop is the ultimate adult’s playground that comes alive once you step inside. The DJ there assumes full responsibility in setting the mood for this area; they are bringing the best of house, disco, techno and every sub genre in between with influence from DJs such as Honey Dijon, Peggy Gou, and Hunee. Three floors starting from the enchanting outdoor rooftop Fairy Garden, heading down to the dark enclosed Butterfly Room and then finally deep underground into the cast iron space resembling an iron mine with a mythical twist, The Iron Fairies Kuala Lumpur is primed to be the flagship jewel of TREC occupying three units and two roof terraces which all comes together to unfold a visual story in each unique space.",
