Conventional point-source loudspeakers would have exacerbated these echo problems.\n\nTo address this, K-Array Vyper-KV52 loudspeakers were selected for their ultra-flat line-array design and proprietary Pure Array Technology. With a tight 10-degree vertical dispersion, the KV52 directs sound precisely towards the listening area, significantly reducing unwanted reflections and effectively minimising echo within the space.\n\nIn the Sales Gallery, Four KV52 units were deployed in a four-corner configuration and paired with a K-Array KU26 subwoofer, achieving immersive and evenly distributed audio coverage across the floor.\n\nIn the lounge area, high-end Audac Celo 8 and Celo 2D ceiling loudspeakers were installed alongside discreet Audac Ateo 6 wall-mounted speakers with CleverMount™ 6 brackets.

This combination delivers clarity across the full venue while providing the energy and headroom required for DJ sets and live events.

A range of Sennheiser wireless microphones—including handheld, bodypack, and headworn options—ensures clear vocal reproduction for presenters, performers, and panel discussions. Playback sources are handled seamlessly via the TACH MF4000 media player, supporting multiple formats for reliable daily operation.\n\nThe visual system was designed for impact and versatility, centred around a Panasonic PT-DW750BA 7,000-lumen projector paired with a custom motorised projector lift and a 16′ x 16′ motorised screen, allowing the technology to disappear when not in use.
