A cult brand, The Iron Fairies origins’ draw back to the story books written by Australian iron ore miner-turned-interior designer Ashley Sutton who escaped into a fantasy world of fairies which then inspired the tale that immortalised into what is The Iron Fairies bars today.The Butterfly Room is where 50, 000 handmade butterflies hang from the ceiling and a DJ on Friday & Saturday is setting the tone accordingly with music ranging from old-school house to techno from midnight till 5am. Think along the style of Joey Negro, Frankie Knuckles, Derrick Carter, and so on. The Fairy Garden encapsulates the life & soul of The Iron Fairies. With different areas for seating and dancing reinforced with a powerful sound system by K-array, this rooftop is the ultimate adult’s playground that comes alive once you step inside. The DJ there assumes full responsibility in setting the mood for this area; they are bringing the best of house, disco, techno and every sub genre in between with influence from DJs such as Honey Dijon, Peggy Gou, and Hunee. Three floors starting from the enchanting outdoor rooftop Fairy Garden, heading down to the dark enclosed Butterfly Room and then finally deep underground into the cast iron space resembling an iron mine with a mythical twist, The Iron Fairies Kuala Lumpur is primed to be the flagship jewel of TREC occupying three units and two roof terraces which all comes together to unfold a visual story in each unique space.",

Courtside seating, social rail positions and gaming zones all sit inside the same carefully shaped coverage, so no guest ever feels off-axis or outside the experience. It is hospitality-led performance sound: immersive, precise and composed, with the gentle polish you would expect from a luxury maison rather than a typical sports venue."

The system is voiced to deliver club-grade dynamics when the room shifts into DJ mode, yet remains refined and low-fatigue at background levels for coaching blocks or social afternoons. Time alignment, level calibration and preset-driven control mean operators can move from training, to match, to night programme with a single recall — maintaining the same luxurious tonal signature at every setting."
