    "story": "GH4 is a high-performance, ultra-compact point source satellite loudspeaker engineered to deliver powerful and controlled sound from a remarkably small enclosure. Featuring a 4\" full-range driver with a dual-coil neodymium magnet, GH4 supports variable impedance operation from 4 \u00ce\u00a9 to 16 \u00ce\u00a9, allowing system designers to optimise performance across different amplifier configurations.\n\nThe unique cabinet design significantly reduces rear-side sound emission, improving sound control and minimising energy loss in complex acoustic environments. This results in enhanced intelligibility, tighter coverage, and more efficient sound distribution, particularly in reverberant spaces.\n\nConstructed from robust stainless steel, GH4 is built for long-term reliability in demanding installations. Its sealed enclosure design ensures durability and consistent performance across a wide range of fixed-installation environments.\n\nGH4 can be deployed individually or combined into arrays to achieve higher output and extended coverage. It is available in a passive low-impedance version, as well as an active variant (GH4A) featuring a built-in 60 W amplifier for simplified installation. For harsher environments, GH4M provides a fully sealed solution with enhanced protection and marine-grade anti-corrosion treatment.",
