    "story": "As the younger sibling of the full-size Sapphire loudspeakers, the Sapphire 130iB delivers immersive, high-quality sound while remaining discreetly integrated into your space. Featuring the proprietary ‘Symphony Cell’ resin-impregnated composite soundboard and a meticulously optimised aluminium frame, it offers a rich, articulate presentation with slightly less low-frequency extension than its larger siblings. Designed for projects where performance, discretion, and installation efficiency matter, the 130iB proves that a smaller form can still feel unmistakably sophisticated.",
