    "story": "The Mobius 3i is the most compact model in Amina’s Mobius range, designed for installations where stud or joist spacing is limited, or where a discreet and cost-effective solution is required. Despite its smaller size, it employs the same core technologies as the flagship Mobius 7i — including proprietary transducers with Optidrive®, Opti-damping® and Reduced Resonance Exciter® innovations — to deliver clear, natural performance that extends well into the ultrasonic region. Perfect for use in secondary spaces such as guest rooms, corridors, or ancillary areas, the Mobius 3i ensures a consistent listening experience across larger projects while maintaining the seamless integration of invisible audio.",
